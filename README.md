# GettingAndCleaningData
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

In this project we have created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  - creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

We have submitted:
  1) a tidy data set called "Tidydata.txt"generated by the run_analysis.R code, 
  2) a link to a Github repository with R script for performing the analysis, and 
  3) a code book called "called CodeBook.md" that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that we performed to clean up the data .  

We used data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The data for the project is given by the follwoing ling

The project data were saved in a folder called: UCI HAR Dataset.
